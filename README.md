Make sure you have `docker` and `docker-compose` working locally.

To start the app run `docker-compose up`. If everything worked correctly you should see `Running on http://0.0.0.0:5000/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)` in the docker logs.

Then to see the site locally, run `docker-machine ip` to get the ip address and visit the ip address on `port 5000`.
For example, `http://192.168.99.100:5000/`.

Let me know if you have issues please :)
